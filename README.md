# TotallyOP
A Minecraft mod for builders. It contains totally overpowered tools and flowers. It does things like harvesting plants, cutting down trees, smelting ores, compressing blocks, ...

The mod is built around a very peacful flower. You can find it in the world (not too rare) and you can grow them with any kind of bonemeal/fertiliser.
You can create all kind of tools and functional flowers with it.

#Peaceful Tool
It is quite powerful and replaces all other tools (including shears) and can do vein mining.
Left click is your regular tool (shovel, axe or pickaxe) and a right click will use a shear function.
When you sneak and right click the tool will toggle between silk touch and furtune (tier depends on the tier of the tool).
When you sneak and left click it will start vein mining and do so until you stop sneaking.

#Rough Tool
It has Fortune V and will dig holes from 15x15 to 3x3 either round or square. Use sneak and mouse wheel to set the size.
It can build up and down at angles of 22.5° and 45° depending on the angle you are looking down/up.

#Alphorn
It moves everything shearable in a range of 33x9x33 centerd around the player to the player.

You can tier up by rightclicking the block with a block of gold, it will change its appearence as well. Right click the flower with an empty hand to find its specs.

They also have a built in filter. Right click it with an item to limit operations to that item only, right click again to blacklist that item.

You can also apply redstone to disable its function.

All flowers can operate on inventories as well as with items in the world. Input inventory is the one directly in front of it, output is below, above left, right and behind it.
